# Monitor Rotator

This is the code for [this article](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/build-an-automatic-computer-display-rotator-with-an-arduino/), which I wrote.
It's about an Arduino project for automatically rotating the display on your computer when the monitor is physically rotated.
